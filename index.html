<h2>
    OverRun64&copy; Privacy Policy
</h2>

<p>
OverRun64&copy is an app developed by Luca Angeletti.<br>
Location: Rome - Italy.<br>
Email: overrun64@icloud.com<br>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Purpose of Processing</strong><br>
OverRun64&copy accesses HealthKit upon user authorization to generate workout videos by using workout data.
OverRun64&copy does not collect or store any form of private data from the users within its own systems or on third-party systems (with the exception of Apple according to its privacy policy).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Legal Basis</strong><br>
The legal basis for processing is the user's consent, which is entirely optional.
Since the legal basis is consent, the user has the right to withdraw consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal; withdrawal of consent implies the inability to use the app.
If authorization to HealthKit is not granted, the app will not function.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Map Services</strong><br>
OverRun64&copy employs iOS MapKit APIs to transmit workout location data to Apple services for the purpose of fetching map imagery necessary for the creation of workout videos.
We do not store any of this location data within our own systems.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Apple's Privacy Policy</strong><br>
While using OverRun64&copy, Apple may collect and process certain data in accordance with its own policies.
